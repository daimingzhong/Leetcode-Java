Given n, how many structurally unique BST's (binary search trees) that store values 1...n?

For example,
Given n = 3, there are a total of 5 unique BST's.

   1         3     3      2      1
    \       /     /      / \      \
     3     2     1      1   3      2
    /     /       \                 \
   2     1         2                 3

first layer 1, 2 ,3
second layer left, right.

First note that dp[k] represents the number of BST trees built from 1....k;

Then assume we have the number of the first 4 trees: dp[1] = 1 ,dp[2] =2 ,dp[3] = 5, dp[4] =14 , how do we get dp[5] based on these four numbers is the core problem here.

The essential process is: to build a tree, we need to pick a root node, then we need to know how many possible left sub trees and right sub trees can be held under that node, finally multiply them.

To build a tree contains {1,2,3,4,5}. First we pick 1 as root, for the left sub tree, there are none; for the right sub tree, we need count how many possible trees are there constructed from {2,3,4,5}, apparently it's the same number as {1,2,3,4}. So the total number of trees under "1" picked as root is dp[0] * dp[4] = 14. (assume dp[0] =1). Similarly, root 2 has dp[1]*dp[3] = 5 trees. root 3 has dp[2]*dp[2] = 4, root 4 has dp[3]*dp[1]= 5 and root 5 has dp[0]*dp[4] = 14. Finally sum the up and it's done.

Now, we may have a better understanding of the dp[k], which essentially represents the number of BST trees with k consecutive nodes. It is used as database when we need to know how many left sub trees are possible for k nodes when picking (k+1) as root.

这个题，因为已经确定了是自然数，所以可以用dp.
