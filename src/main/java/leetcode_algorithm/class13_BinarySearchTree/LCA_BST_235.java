235. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree

Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia:
“The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes v and w
as the lowest node in T that has both v and w as descendants
(where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

   0      _4       7       9
         /  \
         3   5
For example, the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.
Another example is LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

1.
what do I need from next layer?
nothing or result

2. what will I do in this layer
nothing special. because the result is an existing root

3. return value
return root based on cases. because, return 6 when we are finding 2 and 8.


what if it is a list?
